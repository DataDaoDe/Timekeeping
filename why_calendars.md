# What are Calendars used for?

This document breaks down calendars into seven distinct domains. Each domain is in itself a raison d'etre for the existence of calendars and consists of the problems that specific domain attempts to solve.

## Goals
1. [Astronomical Alignment](#astronomical-alignment)
2. [Cognitive Structuring](#cognitive-structuring)
3. Cultural, Religious and Ritual Synchornization
4. Civil and Legal Coordination
5. Global and Technological Coordination
6. Economic and Productive Planning
7. Philosophical and Existential Orientation

## Astronomical Alignment

Calendars track natural cycles of the cosmos for synchronization with human activity.

### Problems Solved:
1. Tracking Solar Years
2. Tracking Lunar Cycles
3. Synchronizing the solar day with atomic and mechanical clocks
4. Adjusting for drift

### Goals:
1. Align Calendar Year with tropical year (~365.24 days)
2. Align months with lunar synodic cycle (~ 29.5 days)
3. Account for [precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession), [equinox drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox) and [leap seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second).

## Cognitive Structuring

Calendars provide mental scaffolding to help humans think about and recall time.

### Problems Solved:
1. Remembering important dates (birthdays, holidays, events, obligations)
2. Structuring time into predictable units (days, weeks, months)
3. Simplifying complex temporal reasoning.

### Goals:
1. Chunk time into hierarchical units (7-day week, 12 months)
2. Provide mnemonic aids (Monday = first day of a 7-day week)
3. Support easy date arithmetic (how many weeks between two dates?)
