# Project Goals

## Primary Goal: The Ultimate Mathematical Timekeeping Framework
The primary goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive mathematical framework and toolset for analyzing, constructing and using of timekeeping systems. In terms of analysis, we need to develop ways to conceptualize and formalize timekeeping systems, specifically calendars.

The framework should not just our work for our own planet earth in our solar system but it should be able to work for humans living on any planetary system with any number of orbital paths, moons, suns, etc. Further, it should also enable quick translation to and from any calendar or timekeeping system across the galaxy and enable quick understanding and comprehension as well as serve as an intergalactic standard.

After the full framework has been developed secondary goals are as follows

## Secondary Goals
1. Use the framework to analyze current calendars and timekeeping systems on earth.
2. Discover which current calendars/timekeeping systems are the best based on developed evaluation metrics.
3. Use the framework to develop calendars and timekeeping systems for the moon, mars, earth orbiting mega-structures (Space Habitats), and various other likely situations
4. Develop the "ideal" calendar and timekeeping system for humans living on earth, using metrics such as evaluation of astronomical alignment and cognitive structuring for optimization.
